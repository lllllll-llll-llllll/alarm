simple alarm script

to add an alarm, open settings.txt and add a time and text message to a new line via the format:
HH:MM<TAB>TEXT
14:15	school bus alarm

restart script if you make any changes to the alarms times

it will play a loud annoying tone that lasts 10 seconds when the system time matches an alarm time in settings.txt
